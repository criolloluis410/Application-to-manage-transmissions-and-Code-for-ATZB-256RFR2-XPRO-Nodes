README APLICATION
In this repository there are all the files necessary to run the application on the computer. The coding is done in Python, for which the PYCHARM IDE has been used, which allows the application to be modified and executed.
The application executable is the file MainApplication.py

README NODE 
The repository contains all the files to edit the source code and run it. The coding of the algorithm has been made to run on the ATZB256RFR2 node
Once the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE is installed, when you run the file RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE.atsln, all the files in the RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE folder that are part of the project are available. This way you can access and modify the coding.
In the RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE folder is the SRC folder in which are the files that contain the algorithm code for the node to function as a sensor node.

When you run the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO.atsln file, the project is opened in the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE. This way you have access to all the information stored in the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO folder.
In the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO folder is the SRC folder in which are the files that contain the coding of the algorithm for the node to function as a controller node.
