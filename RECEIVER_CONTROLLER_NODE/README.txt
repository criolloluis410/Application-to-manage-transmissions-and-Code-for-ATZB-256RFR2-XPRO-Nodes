README RECEIVER CONTROLLER NODE 

The repository contains all the files to edit the source code and run it. 
The coding of the algorithm has been made to run on the ATZB256RFR2 node.

Once the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE is installed, when you run the file 
RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE.atsln, all the files in the RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE 
folder that are part of the project are available. This way you can access 
and modify the coding.

In the RECEIVER_CONTROLLER_NODE folder is the SRC folder in which are the files 
that contain the algorithm code for the node to function as a sensor node.
