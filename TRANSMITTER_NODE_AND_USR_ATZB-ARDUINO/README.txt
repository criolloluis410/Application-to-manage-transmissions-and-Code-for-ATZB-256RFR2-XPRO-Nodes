When you run the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO.atsln file, the project 
is opened in the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE. This way you have access to all the 
information stored in the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO folder.

In the TRANSMITTER_NODE_AND_USR_ATZB-ARDUINO folder is the SRC folder in which
are the files that contain the coding of the algorithm for the node to function 
as a controller node.
